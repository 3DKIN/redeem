Todo list for rev. 0
 - Add an aluminum electrolyt cap to limit LC spikes: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/EEE-1HA101UP/PCE3917CT-ND/766293
 - Add one more 0.1uF ceramic cap near VMM2.
 - Switch places for the caps near Y, Z, Ext1, Ext2 
 - Consider increasing the width of the VMM tracks. 
 - Add more thermal vias for the SMDs
 - Consider adding a coil for noise suppression near the DAC. 
 - Switch the M24C16 EEPROM out with M24C256 to allow for proper addressing, 
 - Switch the 3-switch dip with a two-switch or jumpers. 
 - Consider adding 5.6K pullups on all four i2c lines, (might not be necessary due to pull-ups on beaglebone)
 - connect p9_1 to ground.
 - Change the X2 connector, it does not fit ATX power supplies
 - Move the MOSFETs further apart, consider a way to keep them separated.. 
 - Consider placing the PWM circuit on the I2C2-bus with the EEPROM.
