Umikaze
=======

Umikaze is a complete Linux distribution based on Ubuntu and contains
all the necessary software for running or 3D printer or CNC device with
a `Replicape <Replicape>`__.

..  note:: This image distribution was formerly called `Kamikaze`

| Umikaze 2.1.1 is now available for download. With version 2.1, the way
  the image is created has changed. The image is now made starting from
  the Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS release for BeagleBone, and altered to be great
  for 3D-printing. Redeem, Toggle and OctoPrint is now installed by
  forking the git repository and installing from source. This makes
  hacking very easy, and also enables updates to be monitored from
  within OctoPrints own software update system.


**Download** can be found at `Umikaze 2.1.1 <https://github.com/goeland86/Umikaze2/releases/tag/v2.1.1>`_
