Changelog Rev 1 -> Rev A2
========================
Layout changes 
--------------
 + Make sure on pins are using P8_11..P8_17 and P8_19..P8_21 since they are eMMC on BeagleBone Black
 - Increase the width of the power and MOSFET tracks to tackle 20..30A ~7mm with 35um copper.
 - Change the capacitors for the thermistor to 0402 0.1uF (since there are already a lot of them) 
 - Change the connector for the thermistors to 3-pin in order to add shielding. 
 + Move the stepper connectors outside of the receptacles. 
 - Add a 5V step down converter to power the board from one 12..24V source. 
 - Add a step down/LDO to 12V converter so the mosfet drivers can handle 24V and 12V fans can be used. 
 - Add PTC resettable fuses to the board. 
 - Switch to less oversized MOSFETs. (Ideally I would like the same MOSFETs on hotends and bed..) 
 - Switch to cheaper and non-inverting MOSFET drivers
 - Switch from comparator to BC817 BJTs for the driver levelshifters. 
 - Add a 100R resistor in series with the Gate on the MOSFET to reduce EMI etc. 
 - Increase the LED resistors to reduce brightness..
 + Find cheaper 0.1R resistors for current sensing and also (0.1R * 2.5A) 1/4 W
 - Place a LOW ESR film capacitor of 1uF close to the mosfet drivers.
